This is a assignment which is given to me by rich reach company. In this project what I have done is I have made a application where I was fetching some of the files from firebase and storing them into the local database.The files that I am acessing are only accessible through the google authentication once the authentication is done. those files are stored into my firebase storage from where I am accessing these files. Below I have written the fer steps that how can someone has use this repo.
- first you need to clone this repo in your local computer
- After the cloning please open this project in android studio to run this project
- Running this project requires an android device it could be a emulator or a physical device
- Once you open the app you will se a login button on the first screen of the app by clicking on this button a popup will appear
- it will show you the list of google account that your mobile device has you can select anyone
- When you select any google device you will be moved to the new screen automatically.

- Where they were the served or serving as manager
- This list show some of the details like e.g. employeeName,department,titles,time sprent as manager, isActive or not.
- On the other hand you will see a one more button where it says query builder.
- when you click on the query builder. I will moves you to the new screen where you will see a box to enter text and a button.
- Also you got one more this which is Table structure since this apk is working on sqlLite dataabase. So it relies on the tables
- You only need to load the data for the first time to load the data from the api
- After the if you want you can write the sql query in edittext if you want.
- When you write the query in the edit text and after that when you click on the submit button.
- You will move back to the previous screen where the list is showing which is corresponding to your query
- if the query is not valid it will give you a toast that please enter a valid query also it will not move to the previous screen.
